    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to identify potential in AIM-listed shares with a market capitalization below £10 million. Specifically, it focuses on stocks that have shown significant downside and minimal upside price movement, defined as decreasing by more than 65% and increasing by less than 15% from their closing price 9 months ago. The intent is to screen for companies that may be in a full-on downtrend or have bottomed out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Screening for significant decline is essential because it helps investors identify shares that are experiencing strong negative momentum. Such stocks often reflect underlying factors like deteriorating financial performance, unsuccessful business strategies, or decreased market interest. By identifying these declining opportunities early, investors can capitalize on the downward trends for potentially substantial returns through short selling. Furthermore, understanding these trends can also present opportunities to buy stocks at a lower price if a potential recovery is anticipated. \n",
    "\n",
    "As an AIM investor with enough bruises and scratches to realize that market movements are often unpredictable and vicious, making the screening of stocks for varying thresholds a necessity for you to step back and view what you want to or, more importantly, need to see to help plan your next move of attack.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already run the aim_casino_ticker_collect.ipynb to populate the CSV file used in this project, aim_ticker_list.csv. "
