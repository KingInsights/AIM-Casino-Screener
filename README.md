# AIM Financial Markets Projects

## Introduction

This repository contains multiple projects related to the AIM Financial Markets. The main objective is to identify potential in AIM-listed shares with a market capitalization below £10 million. Each project targets unique screeners and provides insights into different aspects of the market.

## Projects

### [Project 1: High Volatility Screener](aim_casino_screener_high_volatility/README.md)
**Introduction:** This project aims to identify potential in AIM-listed shares with a market capitalization below £10 million. Specifically, it focuses on stocks that have shown significant price movement, defined as exceeding a 65% range (both up and down) of their closing price from 9 months ago. The intent is to find companies that have experienced substantial volatility. Screening for high volatility is important because it can highlight stocks that are experiencing rapid changes in investor sentiment, which could be due to underlying developments or upcoming announcements. High volatility can also indicate that a stock is gaining attention, which might precede a significant price move.

### [Project 2: Low Volatility Screener](aim_casino_screener_low_volatility/README.md)
**Introduction:** This project aims to identify untapped potential in AIM-listed shares with a market capitalization below £10 million. Specifically, it focuses on stocks that have shown minimal price movement, defined as staying within a 32% range (both up and down) of their closing price from 9 months ago. The intent is to find companies that have remained stagnant in terms of price action, indicating potential for a sudden surge or significant development.

### [Project 3: Significant Decline Screener](aim_casino_screener_significant_decline/README.md)
**Introduction:** This project aims to identify potential in AIM-listed shares with a market capitalization below £10 million. Specifically, it focuses on stocks that have shown significant downside and minimal upside price movement, defined as decreasing by more than 65% and increasing by less than 15% from their closing price 9 months ago. The intent is to screen for companies that may be in a full-on downtrend or have bottomed out. Screening for significant decline is essential because it helps investors identify shares that are experiencing strong negative momentum. Such stocks often reflect underlying factors like deteriorating financial performance, unsuccessful business strategies, or decreased market interest. By identifying these declining opportunities early, investors can capitalize on the downward trends for potentially substantial returns through short selling. Furthermore, understanding these trends can also present opportunities to buy stocks at a lower price if a potential recovery is anticipated.

### [Project 4: Significant Growth Screener](aim_casino_screener_significant_growth/README.md)
**Introduction:** This project aims to identify potential in AIM-listed shares with a market capitalization below £10 million. Specifically, it focuses on stocks that have shown significant upside and minimal downside price movement, defined as exceeding a 65% increase and less than a 15% decrease of their closing price from 9 months ago. The intent is to screen for companies that may have either topped out or are in a full-on uptrend. Screening for high-growth stocks is essential because it helps investors identify shares that are experiencing strong positive momentum. Such stocks often reflect underlying factors like improved financial performance, successful business strategies, or increased market interest. By identifying these high-growth opportunities early, investors can capitalize on the upward trends for potentially substantial returns. Furthermore, understanding these trends can also present opportunities to short stocks if a reversal is anticipated.
